Raw Design Draft:

![None Diagram](/images/2-Proposal/AR.png)

**AWS Services Used:**

1. **Amazon EC2** (Compute):
    - t3.micro instance (750h/month Free Tier).
    - Single public subnet (no NAT Gateway needed).
    - Components: Nginx, FastAPI, Redis, React, CloudWatch Agent.
    - Security: Restrictive security groups, Systems Manager Session Manager.

2. **Amazon DynamoDB** (Storage):
    - 4 specialized tables: Metrics, Costs, Security, Recommendations.
    - On-demand pricing mode.
    - TTL enabled for automatic cleanup.
    - Global Secondary Indexes for query optimization.
    - Point-in-time recovery for backups.

3. **Amazon CloudWatch**:
    - Metrics collection with EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, etc.
    - Custom metrics for application monitoring.
    - Logs aggregation.
    - Alarms và notifications.

4. **AWS Cost Explorer**:
    - Cost and usage data via API.
    - Rightsizing recommendations (AWS native).
    - Cost forecast (AWS native).
    - Service breakdown.

5. **AWS Security Hub**:
    - Security findings aggregation.
    - Compliance checking.
    - Integration with GuardDuty.

6. **Amazon GuardDuty** (Optional):
    - Threat detection.
    - Anomaly monitoring.

7. **Amazon S3** (Backup):
    - DynamoDB backup exports.
    - CloudWatch logs archive.

**Single Public Subnet Design:**

The **EC2 instance** is deployed in a **public subnet** with the following **security measures:**

1. **Security Group Configuration:**
    - **Inbound:** Port 80 and 443 open to `0.0.0.0/0`.
    - **Inbound:** Port 22 allowed only from trusted IPs (or fully disabled).
    - **Outbound:** Unrestricted (to allow AWS API calls).

2. **Access Management:**
    - **AWS Systems Manager Session Manager** used instead of SSH.
    - **IAM Roles** designed with the **least privilege principle**.
    - **No hardcoded credentials** in the source code.

3. **Monitoring & Logging:**
    - **VPC Flow Logs** enabled for traffic visibility.
    - **CloudWatch Alarms** configured for security events.
    - **GuardDuty** enabled for continuous threat detection.

**Architecture Decision:**

A **private subnet architecture** was considered but **not implemented** due to:

- **Increased cost:** Additional $33/month for NAT Gateway or ~$14/month for VPC Endpoints.
- **Not suitable for a learning/portfolio project scope**.
- **Public subnet with proper security best practices** is sufficient for this use case.
- Demonstrates **cost-aware decision making**.

This architecture is **appropriate for development or demo environments**.  
For **production deployments**, private subnets with NAT Gateways or VPC Endpoints should be used to enhance network 
isolation and security.

}

```

### **Design Rationale**.

The decision to use **4 specialized tables** instead of 2 aggregated tables is based on clear architectural and operational benefits:

#### **1. Query Performance**

Each table is optimized for a **specific access pattern**:
- **Metrics** → Time-series queries with high write throughput.
- **Costs** → Aggregation queries by service and date range.
- **Security** → Real-time filtering by severity level.
- **Recommendations** → Impact-based sorting and status tracking.

This design minimizes query latency and avoids unnecessary data scans.

#### **2. Separation of Concerns**

- Clear **data ownership** and **lifecycle management**.
- Different **TTL (Time to Live)** policies for each data type.
- Easier to maintain, debug, and evolve over time.

#### **3. Scalability**

- Each table scales **independently** as workloads grow.
- Avoids **hot partitions** caused by data spikes in one category.
- GSIs (Global Secondary Indexes) tailored to specific query needs.

#### **4. Cost Management**

- Enables **granular cost tracking** per data category.
- Flexible TTLs reduce storage cost for short-lived data.
- Uses **on-demand billing**, ideal for variable workloads.

#### **Trade-offs**

- Slightly higher cost (~$2–3/month) compared to 2-table setup.
- Slightly more complexity in deployment and maintenance.
- However, gains include **better performance**, **cleaner architecture**, and **simpler scalability**.
