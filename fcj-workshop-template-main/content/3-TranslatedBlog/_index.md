###  Blog 1 - AWS DMS validation: A custom serverless architecture

This blog presents how AWS designed a custom serverless architecture to automate and optimize the data validation 
process in AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). It provides a step-by-step guide on building a post-migration data 
verification system using AWS Lambda, Step Functions, S3, and DynamoDB — ensuring data integrity and accuracy between 
source and target. Additionally, the blog shares a reference architecture, implementation details of the validation 
workflow, and cost optimization tips for operating the system. <br>

###  Blog 2 - Transforming network operations with AI: How Swisscom built a network assistant using Amazon Bedrock

This blog describes how Swisscom — a major telecommunications provider in Europe — leveraged Amazon Bedrock to build an 
AI Network Assistant that supports network operations. The article explains how the system utilizes large language 
models (LLMs) to automatically analyze logs, diagnose issues, and suggest solutions for network engineers. In addition, 
it introduces the overall AI architecture, the model training and integration process, and the performance and accuracy 
improvements Swisscom achieved through Generative AI. <br>

###  Blog 3 - Introducing the latest AWS Well-Architected Framework: IoT Lens

This blog introduces the AWS Well-Architected IoT Lens, a new extension of the AWS Well-Architected Framework
designed to help businesses architect and evaluate their IoT systems following AWS best practices. The article outlines 
the five core pillars — operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization 
— in the context of IoT, along with reference architectures, best practices, and automated assessment tools. It serves 
as a valuable resource for engineers aiming to ensure their IoT systems are secure, efficient, 
and scalable on the AWS platform. <br>
