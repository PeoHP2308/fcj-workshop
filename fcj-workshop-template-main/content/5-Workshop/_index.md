# Implementing Detailed Security and Access Control for Hybrid S3 Access

#### Overview

**Extended Lab Idea:**  
This lab focuses on applying **Defense-in-Depth** security layers to ensure that only authenticated and authorized sources can access S3 resources through private connections (PrivateLink/VPC Endpoint).

**Lab Objectives:**  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure an **Interface VPC Endpoint** to extend private S3 connectivity to an on-premises (simulated) environment.
- Implement an **Endpoint Policy** to allow access to a specific S3 bucket only.
- Apply an **S3 Bucket Policy** to restrict access based on the source IP address of the on-premises data center.
- Demonstrate that S3 access through endpoints is secured and strictly limited following the **Least Privilege** principle.
